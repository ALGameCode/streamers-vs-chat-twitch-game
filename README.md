 The stone of redemption has come to you, it's time to rid your home of the monsters that destroyed it!!



This is a game created during lives on twitch my channel, where I started the development of the game in Unity with the community that not only helped with ideas and development but also had fun testing it live.



The idea was to develop a game that would be easy and fun to create on stream, as many people showed interest in game development lives. So I thought of a way to make the stream more dynamic and increase public participation in stream and development.



After seeing and playing some very fun games that could be played in interaction with the chat, the idea came up to create a simple but dynamic game that would be fun for the streamer to play along with the chat. Or in this case, against!



In Redemption Stone, the streamer controls an innocent creature that lives on a pacific planet, until it is invaded by monsters and mystical alien creatures that destroy the planet, corrupt its inhabitants, and steal its resources.

While the streamer controls the survivor, who develops skills to face the invaders, the chat has the power to control the legion, the creature responsible for the invasion. The streamer must seek out the power stones, destroy them, and survive the attacks to defeat the legion. On the other hand, the chat commanding the legion must use commands in the Twitch chat to summon in-game creatures and attack the streamer. The objective is to work together to defeat the streamer.
